## 🎯 **TIPS & TRICKS**

### **For Merging:**
- Order matters! Arrange files in the desired sequence
- Add files in batches if you have many
- Check file sizes before merging to estimate final size

### **For Splitting:**
- Use ranges for efficiency (e.g., `1-10` instead of `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`)
- Check page count before entering ranges
- "Split All Pages" is great for extracting images from each page

### **For Compressing:**
- Compress before sending via email
- Already compressed PDFs won't reduce much more
- Text-heavy PDFs compress better than image-heavy ones

---

## ❓ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Failed to process PDF"**
- Ensure the file is a valid PDF
- Try opening it in a PDF reader first
- Check if it's password-protected

### **"Page does not exist"**
- Double-check your page range
- Verify the PDF has that many pages
- Use "1-3" format, not "1,2,3" for ranges

### **Browser crashes with large files**
- Close other browser tabs
- Try a smaller PDF first
- Split large operations into smaller batches

### **Compressed file is same size**
- PDF may already be optimized
- Image-heavy PDFs compress less
- This is normal for some PDFs
